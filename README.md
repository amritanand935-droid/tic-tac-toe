This project is a modern and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to be simple, clean, and beginner-friendly while still offering advanced gameplay features. The game runs entirely in the browser and does not require any external libraries or servers.

The game supports multiple modes, including Player vs Player and Player vs Computer (AI). For single-player mode, the game includes difficulty levels such as Easy, Medium, and Hard, where the Hard mode uses an unbeatable AI (Minimax algorithm). This makes the game both fun and challenging for players of all skill levels.

The interface is responsive and visually appealing, with smooth animations, clear turn indicators, and a restart option. A score counter keeps track of wins, losses, and draws, enhancing replay value. The logic ensures accurate win detection, draw handling, and smooth turn switching.

This project is ideal for students, beginners, and web development learners who want to understand game logic, DOM manipulation, and basic AI concepts in JavaScript. It can also be easily extended with themes, sounds, or online multiplayer features.

Feel free to fork, modify, and improve the project!
